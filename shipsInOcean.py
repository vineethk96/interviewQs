# Imagine an ocean where ships are marked with the char x.
# You are provided a function hasShip(a, b) which accepts tuples
# This function returns a boolean on if a ship exists within 
# the two coordinates.

# Goal: create a function countShips(a, b) which leverages 
# hasShip to determine the amount of ships in the ocean.
